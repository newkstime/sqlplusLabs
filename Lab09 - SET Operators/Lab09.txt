Lab for week 9


1. Using HR schema, write a query that displays a list of department IDs for departments that do not contain the job ID ST_CLERK. Use the MINUS set operator to create this report.  

SELECT department_id
FROM employees
MINUS
SELECT department_id
FROM employees
WHERE job_id = 'ST_CLERK'
ORDER BY 1;

---optional---

write a query that displays a list of department IDs except for those employees that are in Department 50. Use the MINUS set operator to create this report.  

SELECT department_id
FROM employees
MINUS
SELECT department_id
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 50
ORDER BY 1;



2. Write a query to union the departments table with the employees table using the department id, department name, employee last name, and manager id.  Label the name columns as a generic heading called "Names".


SELECT department_id, department_name, TO_CHAR (NULL) "Names", manager_id
FROM departments
UNION
SELECT department_id, TO_CHAR (NULL), last_name "Names", manager_id
FROM employees;




3. Are there any duplicates in question #2 ?   How did you verify this ?

No. The union operator eliminates duplicates.
